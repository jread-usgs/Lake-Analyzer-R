\title{Internal energy function (Joules)}
\usage{
internal.energy(wtr, depths, bthA, bthD)
}
\arguments{
\item{wtr}{a numeric vector of water temperature in degrees C}

\item{depths}{a numeric vector corresponding to the depths (in m) of the wtr measurements}

\item{bthA}{a numeric vector of cross sectional areas (m^2) corresponding to bthD depths}

\item{bthD}{a numeric vector of depths (m) which correspond to areal measures in bthA}
}
\value{
internal energy in Joules. (Currently not vectorized..)
}
\description{
Calculates the internal energy of the water column with temperature and hypsography
}
\details{
Internal energy is the thermal energy in the water column, which is calculated by
multiplying the specific heat of water (J kg-1 K-1) by the temperature and mass of the water
in the lake.
