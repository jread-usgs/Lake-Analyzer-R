\title{Calculate the Schmidt stability}
\usage{
schmidt.stability(wtr, depths, bthA, bthD, sal = wtr * 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{wtr}{a numeric vector of water temperature in degrees C}

\item{depths}{a numeric vector corresponding to the depths (in m) of the wtr measurements}

\item{bthA}{a numeric vector of cross sectional areas (m^2) corresponding to bthD depths}

\item{bthD}{a numeric vector of depths (m) which correspond to areal measures in bthA}

\item{sal}{a numeric vector of salinity in Practical Salinity Scale units}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of Schmidt stability (J/m^2)
}
\description{
Schmidt stability, or the resistance to mechanical mixing
due to the potential energy inherent in the stratification of the water column.
}
\details{
Schmidt stability was first defined by Schmidt (1928) and later modified by
Hutchinson (1957). This stability index was formalized by Idso (1973) to reduce the
effects of lake volume on the calculation (resulting in a mixing energy requirement
per unit area).
